            <p>
                Do you know that according to Google, the monthly search volume for anime related topics is up to over 1 Billion times? Anime is famous worldwide and it is no wonder we've seen a sharp rise in the number of free anime streaming sites.

                Just like free online movie streaming sites, anime watching sites are not created equally, some are better than the rest, so we've decided to build AniWatch.to to be one of the best free anime streaming site for all anime fans on the world.
            </p>

                        <h2> What is Anime.?</h2>
            <p>
                Anime. is a free site to watch anime and you can even download subbed or dubbed anime in ultra HD quality without any registration or payment. By having only one ads in all kinds, we are trying to make it the safest site for free anime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before building AniWatch.to, we've checked many other free anime sites, and learnt from them. We only keep the good things and remove all the bad things from all the competitors, to put it in our AniWatch website. Let's see how we're so confident about being the best site for anime streaming:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> We try our best to avoid harmful ads on AniWatch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Library:</strong> Our main focus is anime. You can find popular, classic, and current titles from all genres.</li>
                <p>such as action, drama, kids, fantasy, horror, mystery, police, romance, school, comedy, music, game and many more. All these titles come with English subtitles or are dubbed in many languages.
                </p>
                Quality/Resolution: All titles are in excellent resolution, the best quality possible. AniWatch.to also has a quality setting function to make sure our users can enjoy streaming no matter how fast your Internet speed is. You can stream the anime at 360p if your Internet is being ridiculous, Or if it is good, you can go with 720p or even 1080p anime.
                Streaming experience: Compared to other anime streaming sites, the loading speed at AniWatch.to is faster. Downloading is just as easy as streaming, you won't have any problem saving the videos to watch offline later.

                Device compatibility: AniWatch works alright on both your mobile and desktop. However, we'd recommend you use your desktop for a smoother streaming experience.
